Lab 3 - Bank Record Analytics

A bank has received a .csv file containing raw data of various clients.

Using Lab 2 as the foundation of the code, now implement the use of the java.util.comparator utility class to
create a data analysis based of the records in the .csv file.

Records.java will print out to the console and print out to a .txt file

- Average income for males vs. females
- Number of females with a mortgage and savings account
- Number of males with both a car and 1 child per location
